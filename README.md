# Getting Started

1. I bootstrapped this assessment with Create React App, you'll also notice that there are two package.json in this application. I am using concurrently to run both the React app and Server at the same time. We're also using a proxy server to tell our Web-pack development server to proxy our API requests to our API server.

## Installation

1. You're going to want to first start by running Yarn add. (This is going to install all of our dependencies.)

2. To run this app simply run Yarn dev.

3. Our server will be running on localhost:3000
